## Week 08 Reflection
For week 08 I was consistent with design functionality by using rehashing methods and making sure not to use duplicate code.
However, I did notice that I was missing a hashPosition() and updateLoadFactor() method. Professor Leo's solution checks loas factor prio to adding a node which makes for cleaner code logic.
The given solution also has a RESIZE constant which I noticed but for whatever reason decided to go about it the harder way. It might be due to the fact that I've never personally written code in that syntax so I might not have felt comfprtable implementing it. 
The rehash logic was just overall neater. I believe I duplicated my hashtable instead.
I've learned to better utilize naming header/constants and to think of the logic more objectively than just overworking my brain and the program.
I'm still working on documenting more of my notes within the code, but I try to keep it minimal because it makes the code easier to read.
